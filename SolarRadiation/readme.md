# Solar Radiation 🌞🌻

- Work done using a Kaggle database. Throughout its development, it explains how to use simple and multiple linear regression models to correlate solar radiation with ambient temperature, barometric pressure, and other variables. This code was my first project in R, and I have used it as an example and guide for future works.
